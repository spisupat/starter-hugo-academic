Hi, I'm Sashank! I am a machine learning scientist at [Limbic](https://limbic.ai), before which I was a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University with [Dr. Yael Niv](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/yael-niv). I am passionate about developing computational models to tackle complex real-world problems. I enjoy cross-disciplinary collaborations, making music and lifelong learning.

In my current work, I use principles from machine learning and computational psychiatry to help develop assistive tools for patients and clinicians throughout the care pathway. In my previous research, I studied the algorithmic inductive biases that allow humans and animals to learn efficiently in [challenging environments](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/pisupati_lifelong_learning.pdf), and the ways in which they may turn [maladaptive](https://rldm.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RLDM2022_cameraready.pdf#page=495) in certain [psychiatric conditions](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(21)00810-6/fulltext).
