Hi, I'm Sashank! I am a researcher with 5+ years of experience in developing machine learning models to personalise support in healthcare settings.

Currently, I'm a machine learning scientist at [Limbic](https://limbic.ai), where I'm focused on creating safe and reliable clinical AI for mental healthcare providers and patients throughout the care pathway. In my work, I use a combination of LLMs, deep supervised learning and RL to develop grounded models and evaluate/improve their safety and performance for real-world applications. 

Previously, I was a researcher at Princeton University in the [Dr. Yael Niv](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/), where I modeled human inductive biases for continual learning, in order to personalize psychotherapy. I enjoy cross-disciplinary collaborations, making music and writing [poetry](https://thelemonbot.wordpress.com).

<!-- I did my PhD in computational neuroscience with [Dr. Anne Churchland](https://churchlandlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/), studying the failure modes of multimodal decision-making.

I'm a machine learning scientist at [Limbic](https://limbic.ai), where I'm focused on creating safe and reliable clinical AI throughout the mental healthcare pathway. In my work, I use large language models, deep supervised learning, and reinforcement learning to build assistive tools for healthcare providers and patients alike. I have over five years of experience in developing machine learning models to personalise support in real-world healthcare settings.

before which I was a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University with [Dr. Yael Niv](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/yael-niv). I am passionate about developing computational models to tackle complex real-world problems. I enjoy cross-disciplinary collaborations, making music and lifelong learning.

In my current work, I use principles from machine learning and computational psychiatry to help develop assistive tools for patients and clinicians throughout the care pathway. In my previous research, I studied the algorithmic inductive biases that allow humans and animals to learn efficiently in [challenging environments](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/pisupati_lifelong_learning.pdf), and the ways in which they may turn [maladaptive](https://rldm.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RLDM2022_cameraready.pdf#page=495) in certain [psychiatric conditions](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(21)00810-6/fulltext).  -->
