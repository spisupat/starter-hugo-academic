Hi, I'm Sashank! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, passionate about using computational models to tackle complex real-world problems. I enjoy music, poetry, cross-disciplinary collaborations and lifelong learning.

In my current research, I study the algorithmic inductive biases that allow humans and animals to learn efficiently in challenging environments, and the ways in which they may turn maladaptive in certain psychiatric conditions.
